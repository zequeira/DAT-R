# DAT-R: Data Analysis in R

The file "data_analysis.R" shows some frequently executed statistical analyses on data collected in speech quality assessment studies.
The files "itut.results15.csv" and "Batch_*.csv"  represents the speech quality ratings collected from the crowdsourcing listeners, whereas "Laboratory_data.xlsx" are the quality ratings from the listeners in the Laboratory that executed the listening test in an optimal environment.

"itut.results15.csv" corresponds to the data gathered in the study described at [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2) (CS 501).

Most of the analyses performed in "data_analysis.R" were for the article [[3]](#3).
